# Express server

This is a basic [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server. Refer to the [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/) for information on how to develop with it.

## Developing locally

Run `npm run dev` to start a local server. Node.js will watch the files associated with running this server and refresh the server upon any changes to the files.

To emulate a production setup, run `npm start` instead.
